# FSDL Text Recognizer Project

This is the admin version of the Full Stack Deep Learning project.

The instructions that students will see start in [Lab 1 Instructions](instructions/lab1.md).

To create the `fsdl-text-recognizer-project` directory, with files subsetted into labs and lab solutions, run `admin/tasks/subset_repo_for_labs.sh`.
